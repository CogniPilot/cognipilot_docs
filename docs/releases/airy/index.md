# About Airy Alicanto

An [Alicanto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alicanto) is a bird from  Chilean mythology known to eat gold or silver and then glow. The bird is incapable of flight after overindulging on ore.

Airy Alicanto represents the origin of our light weight, and minimalistic software stack following a [correct by construction](http://wiki.c2.com/?CorrectByConstruction) software paradigm. By minimizing the lines of source code and branching, we ensure higher reliability, maintainability, and verifiability of the project.

Our goal is for CogniPilot to support a wide variety of vehicles (Planes, Copters, Boats, Rovers, Submersibles) and user applications while maintaining software integrity and reliaiblity. We plan to limit official support for each release to a minimal amount of vehicles for each class, while providing out of tree support via templates.

Currently supported platforms:

### Rover
   * MrBuggy3
   * ELM4

In our upcoming release, to be named, but going by B-Mythical (a mythical creature with a name starting with B), we plan to additionally support:

### Mulirotor
   * NXP RDDrone
   * TBD
### Submersible
   * TBD
### Plane
   * TBD
