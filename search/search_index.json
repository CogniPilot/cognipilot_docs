Step-by-step Download the pre-built latest Ubuntu 22.04 with ROS2 Humble and CycloneDDS image , specifically designed for use with the Create\u00ae 3. Extract the image navqplus-image-<version>.wic from the compressed downloaded file navqplus-image-<version>.wic.bz2 and flash it to an SD card or the EMMC . Log in for the first time by connecting to your computer using the USB to UART adatper , ethernet adapter or centermost (USB 2) USB-C\u00ae port . 2 Configure Wifi, System User Name and Password. Connect to NavQPlus over WiFi Flashing the SD card The NavQPlus comes with a 32GB SD card that you can flash with the pre-built Ubuntu 22.04 image. See below for instructions to flash your SD card on each platform. Attention You must have an SD card reader available on your system to perform these instructions. To flash your SD card with the image you downloaded in step 1, we suggest using dd . To do this, open a terminal and navigate to the folder that you downloaded the navqplus-image-<version>.wic file. Once you are there, insert your SD card, and find the device path for it. Typically, it will be something like /dev/sdX . Attention Be careful that you select the correct drive path when using dd to flash your SD card. You can confirm with the \"Disks\" app on Ubuntu. Once you have found your device path, run the following command in your terminal to flash the SD card: sudo dd if=navqplus-image-<version>.wic of=/dev/sdX bs=1M status=progress oflag=sync Once this is done, your SD card will be flashed with the image. Make sure that your boot switches are set to boot from SD. Flashing the eMMC To flash the eMMC on your NavQPlus, you will need to download UUU , a tool created by NXP to flash NXP boards. Make sure to download the correct application for your platform. The file titled \"uuu\" with no file extension is a binary file for use on x86/64 Linux. Once you have downloaded UUU, find the boot switches on your NavQPlus and flip them to the \"Flash\" mode. Then, connect NavQPlus to your computer using the leftmost (USB 1) USB-C\u00ae port and the two flash status light should light up as shown in the image. Run the following command to make sure that the NavQPlus is recognized by UUU: ./uuu -lsusb You should see that there is a device detected. If so, you can continue flashing. To flash your board, use the command below: ./uuu -b emmc_all navqplus-image-<version>.bin-flash_evk navqplus-image-<version>.wic Once this process has finished, make sure that the flash was successfull by comparing to the image below. If so, configure your boot switches to boot from eMMC. Boot Switches NavQPlus can be configured to boot from either SD card or eMMC. It also has a flash mode that allows you to flash either the eMMC or SD card over USB-C\u00ae. See the table below for the boot switch configuration. Mode Switch 1 Switch 2 SD ON ON eMMC OFF ON Flash ON OFF Log in for the first time Power on the NavQPlus by plugging in a USB-C\u00ae cable to the centermost (USB 2) USB-C\u00ae port. NavQPlus will boot, and you will be able to confirm it has fully booted by observing the LEDs on board. The 3 LEDs by the USB1 port should be on, as well as two LEDs next to the CAN bus connectors. To log into NavQPlus, you can use the included USB to UART adapter , Ethernet , or USB-C\u00ae gadget mode (recommended) . The default username/password combo is as follows: Username: user Password: user USB to UART adapter Connect the included USB to UART adapter to the UART2 port on the NavQPlus, and open your favorite serial console application. Open a serial console with a baud rate of 115200. Press enter if there is no output on the screen to get a log-in prompt. Ethernet Connect the included IX Industrial Ethernet cable to NavQPlus, and connect the RJ45 connector to your computer, switch, or router on your local network. You can log into NavQPlus over SSH. The default hostname for NavQPlus is imx8mpnavq. To SSH into NavQPlus, you can run the following command: ssh user@imx8mpnavq.local USB-C\u00ae Gadget Ethernet The IP address of the usb0 network interface on NavQPlus is statically assigned to 192.168.186.3. If you want to use USB-C\u00ae gadget ethernet to connect to NavQPlus, you will need to assign a static IP to your existing gadget ethernet interface on your computer. The network configuration is as follows: IP Address: 192.168.186.2 Network Mask: 255.255.255.0 Once you have set up your USB-C\u00ae gadget ethernet interface on your computer, you can SSH by running: ssh user@imx8mpnavq.local Expand Image The flashed images will need expanding to utilize all the available storage. After logging into the NavQPlus open a terminal and run: Expand image on the SD: echo -e \"d\\n2\\nn\\np\\n2\\n196608\\n\\n\\nw\" | sudo fdisk /dev/mmcblk1 && sudo resize2fs /dev/mmcblk1p2 Expand image on the eMMC: echo -e \"d\\n2\\nn\\np\\n2\\n196608\\n\\n\\nw\" | sudo fdisk /dev/mmcblk2 && sudo resize2fs /dev/mmcblk2p2 Configuring WiFi, System Username and Password Configuring WiFi on NavQPlus To connect NavQPlus to your local WiFi network, you can use the nmcli command. The interface is relatively straightforward, to connect with nmcli , run the following command: sudo nmcli device wifi connect <network_name> password \"<password>\" Once you are finished connecting to your local WiFi network, you can exit the application. Your NavQPlus will continue to connect to this WiFi network even after a reboot. Configuring System Username and Password To change the default username and password, use the commands below. Username: usermod -l <new_username> user mv /home/user /home/<new_username> Password: passwd Connecting to NavQPlus over WiFi Once you have set up your NavQPlus to connect to your local WiFi network, you can now SSH into your NavQPlus over WiFi by running: ssh <your-username>@imx8mpnavq.local Ubuntu is a registered trademark of Canonical Ltd. \u21a9 USB-C\u00ae is a trademark of USB Implementers Forum. \u21a9 ROS 2 is governed by Open Robotics \u21a9","title":"Setup"},{"location":"cranium/compute/navqplus/setup/#connect-navqplus-and-set-up-ros-2-humble","text":"","title":"Connect NavQPlus and set up ROS 2 Humble"},{"location":"cranium/compute/navqplus/setup/#before-you-start","text":"Important The NavQPlus Ubuntu 22.04 with ROS 2 Humble image uses CycloneDDS by default. 1 3 Attention These directions are written for someone with experience with embedded Linux and basic embedded computers.","title":"Before you start"},{"location":"cranium/compute/navqplus/setup/#step-by-step","text":"Download the pre-built latest Ubuntu 22.04 with ROS2 Humble and CycloneDDS image , specifically designed for use with the Create\u00ae 3.
